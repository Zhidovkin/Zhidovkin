## Hello from Krasnodar!

Hello there! My name is Ilya, and I am 20 years old. Currently, I am a student at KubG–êU in Krasnodar, studying Information Technologies (09.03.02). Although programming is still new to me, I have experience with C#, C++, Python, and am eager to grow as a programmer.

## My Journey

I started my journey with programming about a year ago and quickly found it fascinating. Here are some of the languages and technologies I have explored:

- **C++:** Experience in developing applications using .NET.
- **Python:** Data science, machine learning, web development, automation.
- **C#:** Interest in building robust desktop applications.

## My Interests

I love:

- Writing code in Visual Studio Code.
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks.
- Learning from the latest resources available online.

## Resources I Find Useful

Since I am still a beginner, here are some resources that have been helpful for me:

### Programming Languages
- **C++:** Essential for competitive programming and system-level applications.
- **Python:** Great for data science and machine learning projects (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript:** For web development basics.

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **React.js:** For building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean design.
